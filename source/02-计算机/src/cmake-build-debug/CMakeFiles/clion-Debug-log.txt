CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (add_executable):
  The target name "01-LinearList/1_1_LinkList.cpp" is reserved or not valid
  for certain CMake features, such as generator expressions, and may result
  in undefined behavior.
